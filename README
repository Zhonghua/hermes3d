Compilation
------------

$ cmake .
$ make

Intel C Compiler
----------------

To use Intel C compiler

$ export CC=/path/to/icc
$ export CXX=/path/to/icpc
$ cmake .
$ make

NOTE: version 10.0.026 did not work for me (some compatibility issues with STL), 10.1.022 works ok

Tests
-----

To run tests, do:

$ make test-quick

To run all tests (warning: takes very long time to finish):

$ make test


Examples
--------

To build examples, type:

$ make examples

To get output files that can be viewed in a visualizer, you need to say:

set(OUTPUT_DIR /path/where/the/files/will/be/stored)

To view the files:
# gmsh my-file.gmsh (for gmsh)
# paraview --data=my-file.vtk (for VTK)


Debugging
---------

If you need to debug the build, use:

cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON .

Then the make will print the exact commands that are executed.
