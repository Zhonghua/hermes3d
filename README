Compilation
------------

If you use Debian/Ubuntu, do:

$ cp CMake.vars.Debian CMake.vars

(If you use some other system, copy CMake.vars.sample and customize it.)

$ cmake .
$ make

Tests
-----

To run tests, do:

$ make test-quick

To run all tests (warning: take very long time to finish):

$ make test

Debugging
---------

If you need to debug the build, use:

cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON .

Then the make will print the exact commands that are executed.
